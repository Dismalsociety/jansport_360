Cross-Attention allows the model to "look back" at previous time steps and decide which ones are most important for making the current prediction.

How it works:
Attention Scores: For each time step, it calculates how relevant all other time steps are
pythonscore = torch.tanh(self.attention(hidden))

Attention Weights: Converts scores to probabilities (0-1) that sum to 1
pythonattention_weights = F.softmax(self.v(score), dim=1)

Weighted Output: Multiplies the LSTM outputs by these weights
pythonweighted = hidden * attention_weights

Why it helps:

Without attention: LSTM only remembers through its hidden state (can forget important patterns)
With attention: Can directly access any past time step, especially useful for:

Detecting patterns that lead to pressure dips
Connecting distant but related events
Focusing on the most relevant historical data

Example:
If pressure typically dips 5 time steps after a flow rate spike, the attention mechanism can learn to "pay attention" to what happened 5 steps ago, even if the LSTM's memory has faded.
Think of it like having a highlighter that marks the most important parts of the history for making predictions.
