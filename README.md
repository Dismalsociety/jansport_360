1. Made Model MUCH Simpler

Before: Transformer + Bidirectional LSTM (~50K parameters)
After: Single GRU (~8K parameters)
Result: Can't memorize training data as easily

2. Fixed Data Leakage

Before: Created sequences → then split (sequences overlap!)
After: Split data → then create sequences (no overlap!)
Result: Validation metrics are now trustworthy

3. Added Triple Regularization

Noise: Augments training data (prevents exact memorization)
Dropout: Randomly disables neurons (forces redundancy)
Weight Decay: Penalizes large weights (keeps model simple)
Result: Model learns patterns, not specific examples

Version 13:
Complex Model + Data Leakage + No Regularization = Overfitting

New GRU Model:
Simple Model + Clean Splits + Triple Regularization = Good Generalization

replaced your Transformer+Bidirectional-LSTM with a single GRU layer (reducing parameters from ~50K to ~8K), 
fixed the critical data leakage by splitting data BEFORE creating sequences instead of after, 
added proper 70/15/15 train/val/test splits instead of nested 80/20 splits, 
added Gaussian noise augmentation during training, 
added gradient clipping, 
switched from optional batch normalization to layer normalization, 
added early stopping implementation, 
added best model checkpointing and loading, 
added data shuffling each epoch, 
changed learning rate from 0.001 to 0.0005, 
added weight decay (5e-5) that was missing, 
properly use only training statistics for normalization across all sets, 
added comprehensive metrics (MSE/RMSE/MAE/correlation/R²) instead of just correlation, 
added a scatter plot visualization, 
track generalization gap explicitly, 
moved to simpler architecture (Linear→GRU→Linear instead of Linear→Transformer→BiLSTM→Linear→Linear), 
reduced hidden dimensions throughout, 
ensure validation is computed on clean data while training uses augmented data.RetryClaude can make mistakes.
